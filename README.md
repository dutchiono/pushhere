Here is the site where you can input your catsID and see your cat



and here is the BinanceSmartChain Parsed Cat Data



you have to manually search the code for your wallet address to lookup a catsID.

For now. Don't forget I'm not a dev and probably spent too much of the last week learning what I needed to in JavaScript. 

Step by Step Guide

1. Copy your wallet address

2. Go here and search for your wallet address
       CTRL + F,  or find in page

The first number in any [1,2,3 ] line is your cats rescue order

The second number  is the CatsId

The third number will be your highlighted wallet address if you searched correctly.

Copy the second number and go
Here, paste your cat ID to see your cat :)

It will obviously be alot easier to just click wallet connect and see what your cats are, I just figure you've waited long enough
